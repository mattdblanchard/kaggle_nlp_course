"We were greeted at the door with a smile and seated immediately.  Drink orders were taken and delivered.  The menu was lovely, I ordered oysters and the hunter's rabbit.  Kids ordered bison burgers and frites, husband hot salmon tartar and the veal shank.  The food was really delicious... my oysters were served with a mignonette and the rabbit had a delicious brown sauce were carmelized carrots.  Kids loved their food, one had it plain, one with everything, both were perfectly cooked.  Husband's veal and spaetzle was terrific.  The kids got the chocolate mousse with hazelnuts...they cleaned the dishes.  I had a glass of Pinot noir and my husband had the Kissmeyer Nordic pale ale, which he adored.  The service was on point and we had a spectacular experience.  Thank you for making us feel so welcome on our first night in Montreal!!",5,1
"OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a ""steakhouse,"" it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.

The menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a ""steakhouse"" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.

The wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.

Service was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to ""crabcakes"" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the left and plates removed from the right. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/ 

In sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a ""steakhouse"" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu.",2,0
"I guess we got lucky because we thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. We got there kind of early on a Saturday night (around 5:30-6), so that might be the window for good service as it was busy but not yet packed.  Our server was great (I forgot to catch her name) - attentive but not overly so.  We sat in the outdoor area and it was cool and breezy (the patio lies between 2 buildings which block the sun so it's not roasting out there) and quiet- they were playing some blues/jazz music which was a good volume so that it wasn't overpowering but you still didn't have to hear other people's conversations. Though the metal chairs out there aren't super comfortable, that would be my only complaint.  

We had the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was to die for.  It was a really hearty size, but we could have eaten several more plates of it it was so good.  I had the flat iron steak. I asked for it medium and it came out medium and was perfect.  Hubby had the perogies with jalapeño and was happy.  I had a nice glass of house pinot noir, hubby had a beer on tap.  I feel the prices were reasonable - an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $50 which is not bad for date night.  I would definitely go again next time we're in Homestead.",4,1
"The first thing is that I am actually not a huge cider fan... the first is always great and the second is too sweet.  The second thing is that I am now.  We put ourselves in the hands of the server and got a whiskey cider and Pinot noir cider, which I will admit I didn't even know existed.  A fantastic start the the night.  The space is warm and cozy, loud enough to feel like it is happening but not so loud that you can't hear your dinner date... who is patiently waiting for me to finish this review.  The Caesar salad was perfect.  The butter chicken was everything you want butter chicken to be.  The lost star (4/5) was that naan was basically a warmed up pita.  Come here, ask for recommendations, have a flight, and a great evening.",4,1
"An excellent meal, ambience and service. Had one of the pinot noirs and literally was the best glass of wine of my life.",5,1
"L'ile noire pub is features both a ""beer"" pub and a whisky and cocktail lounge.
Nestled in the Latin quarters, you can find a huge selection on single malt scotch whiskies and beers. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, a great place to go for a drink or two. They serve 1/2 dram on most of their whiskies so you can afford to sample several without getting too intoxicated. The only thing missing is the pub style food! You can drink all night without eating some greasy food. I do have to mention that they do have 3 pre made appetizers to munch on.
I'll be back.",4,1
"Artisan chocolatier dans le quartier du Vieux Saint-Laurent. J'ai peu de check ins ici, malgré le fait que je viens souvent, mais c'est parce que je suis tellement absorbée par le goût délicieux de leur crème glacée que j'en perds tous mes moyens. C'est à distance de marche de chez moi, alors j'adore profiter des belles soirées d'été pour prendre une marche avec mon amoureux et aller chercher un cornet de crème glacée qu'on mange ensuite dans le parc Decelles en regardant les écureuils, le ciel, ou encore l'équipe locale de baseball.

Est-ce que j'ai dit que la crème glacée était bonne? Ils ont une variété de parfums qui changent de semaine en semaine. Mes préférés sont Chocolat belge 70%, Vanille de Madagascar (les deux sont disponibles aussi en crème glacée molle), Menthe et chocolat (comme mâcher des feuilles de menthe fraîchement cueillies, tellement délicieux!), Praliné. Mon amoureux aime particulièrement celle au cappucino et celle à l'amaretto, Il y a aussi des saveurs inusitées comme sésame noir, speculoos, matcha... Et pour les vegans et intolérants au lactose, ils offrent des sorbets sans produits laitiers.

Je ne dirais pas que c'est la meilleure crème glacée en ville (il y a tellement de bonnes crèmeries à Montréal), mais celle-ci, de par la qualité et la proximité, est sans aucun doute ma préférée!",5,1
"Absolutely amazing awesome healthy and delicious food!  The steak and mushrooms are incredible!  Phenomenal Oregon pinot noir wine!  I crave this place daily, hard to find healthy and delicious combined!",5,1
"Came in on a Friday night and only had a 10 minute wait! We got sat outside however they did have the heaters on. Our server, Kaula, greeted us promptly and was very sweet with great suggestions! We ordered a salmon, a bacon and an artichoke bruschetta as well as a bottle of Pinot noir. Our food came out so quick despite the wait!! I definitely recommend this place if you are a wine drinker however it's important to note that they have no liquor!!",5,1
"My friend wanted a specific gin drink and a snack, so we stumbled in to the bar here. We were not disappointed!

Both of the bar tenders on staff were sooo sweet and nice! My wine and water never stayed empty for long.

I tried the Wolfgang puck cab, but it was super light, it almost tasted like a Pinot noir. I opted for the other cab, which was wonderful. 

We also ordered the steak skewers, (super rare and in nice sauce) and also the truffle blue cheese potatoes (kind of like nachos). 

We left full, happy and taken care of.",5,1
